###### Data Representation and Querying - Exercise 5
# Hacker News App
In this exercise we will write a fully fledged Hacker News viewing app.

## Exercises
1. Create a skeleton HTML file with room for CSS and JavaScript.

1. Use jQuery to create a series of AJAX calls to create a list of the top five stories from Hacker News.

1. Using jQuery, add the stories to the HTML content as they arrive. You can just display the relevant details, such as the title, url and score of the stories.

1. Change your code to ensure that the stories appear on the page in order.

1. Have your code check every minute for new top stories, and have the page updated if there are any.

## Advanced exercises
1. Add a "More" button to the bottom of your page which shows five more stories.

1. Instead of the More button, use jQuery to detect when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page to have five more stories shown automatically.

## Notes
- 	You might need the documentation for these: [jQuery.get()](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/), [jQuery.each()](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/), [jQuery.append()](http://api.jquery.com/append/), [jQuery.after](http://api.jquery.com/after/), [jQuery.before()](http://api.jquery.com/before/).
